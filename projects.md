Below are a collection of some of my favorite projects I have worked on. They may be born out of research, class assignments, formal extracurriculars, or pure personal interest. In some cases I haven't posted the actual work, because others contributed to it and I have not received their permission to share.

# City Planning x Data Science

### SB-1120 Policy Brief
- **Co-Authors**: David Garcia, Julian Tucker

Senate Bill 1120, at the time of this writing, is proposed legislation in California that would allow for single-family residential lots to be split into two equally-sized lots. New construction could be built on the split lot, thus increasing density in residential neighborhoods. The Terner Center here at Berkeley was working on a policy brief in support of SB-1120, and they called on me to run the numbers. Namely, I determined the total counts and percentages of parcels throughout the state to which this new law would apply, which are referenced throughout the report. I'm definitely proud to have published my first "formal" work! Read the [blog post](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/news/single-family-zoning-reform-SB-1120) and check out the full brief ([PDF](http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/uploads/Single-Family_Zoning_Reform_An_Analysis_of_SB_1120.pdf)).

### Bike Lanes and Displacement
- **Co-Authors**: Khoa Đỗ, Rowan Pan

For a class assignment, my group and I looked at the relationship between the existence of bike lanes and urban displacement, as measured by the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). I collected bike lane shapefiles from various city open data portals, which I then used to calculate the total length of bike lanes per census tract. My groupmates then used that information to look at potential associations with the typologies created by UDP. We then put everything in an interactive blog post, which you can read [here](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ischmidt/2020/cp-101-assignment-3/).

### BART and Accessibility
- **Co-Author**: Rowan Pan

For another assignment, my partner and I investigated factors affecting accessibility to BART, particularly looking at the location of the Warm Springs and Fremont stations. I built my own network based on a county street centerlines shapefile, which I used to calculate distance and walking times to BART for various locations. We also used data from the American Community Survey to try to determine the makeup of the neihborhoods these stations serve.
