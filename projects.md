Below are a collection of some of my favorite projects I have worked on. They span a variety of topics including sports, city planning, geography, or whatever happened to be assigned. The first category contains projects for which some kind of "report" was produced and is available. The other two contain projects that do not meet that criteria, split into personal projects and work done for school or research.
