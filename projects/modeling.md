### **Clustering Colors**

In this [paper](/assets/clustering.pdf), I perform k-medoids clustering on the colors of college basketball teams. I was inspired to do this after learning about k-medoids clustering in the Algorithms for Data Science course I took in Fall 2020. It was a fun exercise in LaTeX and machine learning software packages. Check it out!

### **Stock Price Analysis**
- **Co-Authors**: Holly Cheek, Justin Han, Leonard Yang

For a Time Series class I took in Spring 2020, our final project was to analyze an anonymized stock price, and predict its future performance. We explored a bunch of different models, ranging from parametric models to SARIMA to basic differencing. We combined all of our findings into a professional-style report, and summarized our findings in a silly blog post. Our model predicted future prices better than at least two-thirds of the class! Not only was this an exercise in different modelling techniques, but in Markdown and LaTeX syntax as well. Read our "blog" [here](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ischmidt/2020/stat-153-project/), or our more detailed final report [here](/assets/stat153.pdf), which also includes all of our R code.
