### **Capstone Project**
- **Co-Contributors**: Atharv Pathak, Jeremy Sanchez, Ishaan Srivastava

As part of the Master's program, we completed a group capstone data science project. Our original [dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) of interest was one of taxi rides in New York, and we first created a kernel estimate of the spatiotemporal distribution of taxi pickups. We then incorporated a [dataset](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) of trips from the CitiBike bike sharing system, which we used to make recommendations on which bike stations to keep open and which to close. I wasn't too happy with the project, but we did alright in the end. You can read my final writeup [here](/assets/stat222.pdf).

### **Clustering Colors**

In this [paper](/assets/clustering.pdf), I perform k-medoids clustering on the colors of college basketball teams. I was inspired to do this after learning about k-medoids clustering in the Algorithms for Data Science course I took in Fall 2020. It was a fun exercise in LaTeX and machine learning software packages. Check it out!

### **Stock Price Analysis**
- **Co-Authors**: Holly Cheek, Justin Han, Leonard Yang

For a Time Series class I took in Spring 2020, our final project was to analyze an anonymized stock price, and predict its future performance. We explored a bunch of different models, ranging from parametric models to SARIMA to basic differencing. We combined all of our findings into a professional-style report, and summarized our findings in a silly blog post. Our model predicted future prices better than at least two-thirds of the class! Not only was this an exercise in different modeling techniques, but in Markdown and LaTeX syntax as well. Read our "blog" [here](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ischmidt/2020/stat-153-project/), or our more detailed final report [here](/assets/stat153.pdf), which also includes all of our R code.
