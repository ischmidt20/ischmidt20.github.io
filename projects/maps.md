### **State Border Highway Crossings**

I saw this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/j6my20/the_best_way_to_cross_each_us_state_border_oc/), categorizing each state border by the level of its highest-grade crossing (Interstate, U.S. route, local road, etc.). I noticed a number of issues in the comments, so I decided to make my own, hopefully better, version. Sadly, it didn't earn anywhere near enough karma as the original, perhaps because it was overshadowed by all of the election maps.

### **Streets**

These maps didn't really require a whole lot of creativity, but they look cool, so I figured I would share them here. Apparently, the U.S. Census Bureau provides [freely available datasets](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/ROADS/) containing every road in the country. I downloaded these for a few regions and used them to create "maps" that could be used as wallpapers.

### **Sacramento County Housing Suitability**
- **Co-Authors**: Bernard Gburek, Valery Yanez

In Fall 2019, I took a class on Geographic Information Systems (GIS). For a final project, we conducted a suitability analysis to find the best place to construct and sell a home in Sacramento County. We collected geospatial data on all sorts of different features, ranging from recent home sale prices to transporation to flood plains. I even used a centerlines file to build a network to calculate travel times to and from important locations such as schools and Amtrak stations. The end product was a raster-based suitability model to determine the "optimal" place for new construction.

### **BART and Housing Prices**

Freshman year, I took a class in the geography department simply titled "California," for which we had to make a map as our final project. Being the public transit fan that I am, I chose to look at BART and its relationship with housing prices. I plotted BART stations as points alongside block group polygons joined with American Community Survey data. This was the first map I ever finished, and I'm quite proud of it. My TA didn't like that I didn't label the stations and thought that the system map in the top-left corner was intended to fill space, so I assume she'd rather see text covering all of San Francisco and a big empty Marin Peninsula. This map is less than 3 years old, but note how out-of-date it already is! Thank you BART!
