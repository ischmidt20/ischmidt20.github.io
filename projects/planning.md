### **SB-1120 Policy Brief**
- **Co-Authors**: David Garcia, Julian Tucker

Senate Bill 1120 was proposed legislation in California that would allow for single-family residential lots to be split into two equally-sized lots. New construction could be built on the split lot, thus increasing density in residential neighborhoods. The Terner Center here at Berkeley was working on a policy brief in support of SB-1120, and they called on me to run the numbers. Namely, I determined the total counts and percentages of parcels throughout the state to which this new law would apply, which are referenced throughout the report. I'm definitely proud to have published my first "formal" work! Read the [blog post](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/blog/sb-1120/) and check out the full brief ([PDF](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Single-Family_Zoning_Reform_An_Analysis_of_SB_1120.pdf)). Unfortunately, [the bill died](https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-09-01/california-assembly-sb-1120-duplexes) during the final hours of the legislative session.

### **Housing Research**

Most of my research with Prof. Chapple has involved working on projects related to housing reform. In addition to the SB-1120 brief, I also worked on collecting and joining datasets for a model that determined the factors driving the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which helped the publication of [our report](https://www.aducalifornia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADU-Progress-in-California-Report-October-Version.pdf). This involved working with large parcel-level datasets for the state of California, as well as other data sources like the ACS and LEHD survey. I also worked on this [map](https://www.aducalifornia.org/) displaying where in the state ADUs are built. Another project that I worked on was trying to determine the number of new units built in the state at the block level, again using parcel data.



### **Bike Lanes and Displacement**

- **Co-Authors**: Khoa Đỗ, Rowan Pan


For a class assignment, my group and I looked at the relationship between the existence of bike lanes and urban displacement, as measured by the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). I collected bike lane shapefiles from various city open data portals, which I then used to calculate the total length of bike lanes per census tract. My groupmates then used that information to look at potential associations with the typologies created by UDP. We then structured our results as a blog post, which you can read [here]({% post_url 2020-05-15-bike-lanes %}).



### **BART and Accessibility**
- **Co-Author**: Rowan Pan

For another assignment, my partner and I investigated factors affecting accessibility to BART, particularly looking at the location of the Warm Springs and Fremont stations. I built my own network based on a county street centerlines shapefile, which I used to calculate distance and walking times to BART for various locations. We also used data from the American Community Survey to try to determine the makeup of the neighborhoods these stations serve. Read our report [here]({% post_url 2020-03-21-bart %})!



### **Monaco 2070**

For my first city planning course, our term paper assignment was to pick a city and outlay a "vision" for how that city might look in 50 years. During one of our class discussions, a student mentioned they were considering Malta, and I decided to follow the microstate idea and picked Monaco. Monaco is unique in that it is very small, very rich, and its own country. Recently it is suffering from a severe lack of housing—even in the most expensive city in the world, demand is far exceeding supply. The city can't grow outwards (it either hits water or an international border), and growing upwards would mean losing it's charm, so I decided to base my vision around a radical underground housing plan. I reference other human underground spaces, such as in Montreal, and the informal underground housing market in China. While my plan is certainly quite unrealistic, this was quite a fun research exercise. I also got to improve my non-existent graphic design skills. No data science here, but still [please read!](/assets/vision2070.pdf)
