### **The Origins of Ethnolinguistic Diversity**
- **Co-Author**: Andrej Leban

In the Linear Models course as part of my Master's program, our final project was to replicate a published paper. We chose [this paper](doi.org/10.1257/aer.102.4.1508), by Stelios Michalopoulos, that modeled that number of languages in different geographical areas as functions of different geographic and political variables. The project involved translating the author's Stata code into R, critiquing the original modeling choices, and extending the author's analysis to a related dataset to check the robustness of the results. It was also an exercise in generating nice LaTeX tables directly from R data frames. Check out our paper [here](/assets/stat230a.pdf), and the corresponding GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/andleb/230Afinal).


### **Graph Distances in the Data-Stream Model**

In Fall 2020, I took a graduate-level class titled "Algorithms for Data Science." Our big project was to present on a published paper in the field. Check it out below:
