Here is a sampling of some of the term papers I have written. The quality may not be the best, but what's the point in writing something if nobody but you and your TA is going to read it? Check these out, maybe you'll learn something. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### **AC Transit Flex**
- **Co-Authors**: Rene Gamino, Elizabeth Rajphackdy

In Spring 2020, I took a class on "urban transportation". Our term paper assignment was to dive in-depth into a specific Bay Area transportation project, from describing its history to analyzing its efficacy. My group chose [AC Transit Flex](http://www.actransit.org/flex/) a relatively new demand-based public transit line that serves the less dense areas of Fremont and Newark. Unfortunately, I can't share the paper, but I just wanted to note how interesting it was reading the [internal reports](http://www.actransit.org/wp-content/uploads/board_memos/14-247b%20Line%20275.Flex%20Service.pdf) about it and listening to the recordings of Board of Directors meetings and all of the different arguments the planners and board members had. I have never actually ridden Flex, because COVID-19 hit before we got a chance to do so.

### **Monaco 2070**

For my first city planning course, our term paper assignment was to pick a city and outlay a "vision" for how that city might look in 50 years. During one of our class discussions, a student mentioned they were considering Malta, and I decided to follow the microstate idea and picked Monaco. Monaco is unique in that it is very small, very rich, and its own country. Recently it is suffering from a severe lack of housing—even in the most expensive city in the world, demand is far exceeding supply. The city can't grow outwards (it either hits water or an international border), and growing upwards would mean losing it's charm, so I decided to base my vision around a radical underground housing plan. I reference other human underground spaces, such as in Montreal, and the informal underground housing market in China. While my plan is certainly quite unrealistic, this was quite a fun research exercise. I also got to improve my non-existent graphic design skills. [Please read!](/assets/vision2070.pdf)

### **Food Miles**

This might be the most out-of-place section here, which may be why it's one of the last. In Spring 2019, I took a class called "Food and the Environment", through which we learned all about the food supply chain, its history, and its consequences for the world. For my term paper, I chose to write about the concept of "food miles", which is a measure of how far your food travels from its seeding ground to your plate. The dominant narrative is that more food miles are bad, bad for the environment and bad for your health, but I offer a critique. Check it out [here](/assets/foodmiles.pdf)!

### **Japan and Korea Historiography**

Everyone in the Letters & Science College at Berkeley has to take at least one writing class, unless you got a 5 on the AP Lit exam, which I did not. Because I don't really like studying fiction, I chose to take my writing class in the history department. My specific course was focused on the relationship between Japan and Korea from the late nineteenth century through the modern day. My favorite reading from the course was *Tenma*, the story of Genryu, a satirical character bouncing around pre-war Seoul. I found a copy [here](https://ceas.uchicago.edu/sites/ceas.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Tenma.pdf), although it's not the same translation I read. Anyway, for my term paper for this class, I wrote about the colonial relationship between Japan and Korea, arguing that it had always been Japan's goal to culturally assimilate Korea into its growing empire. This was the first college term paper I ever wrote, so hopefully it's not too bad. [Read it here!](/assets/historiography.pdf)
