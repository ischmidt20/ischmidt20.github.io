# Modelling

### **Stock Price Analysis**
- **Co-Authors**: Holly Cheek, Justin Han, Leonard Yang

For a Time Series class I took in Spring 2020, our final project was to analyze an anonymized stock price, and predict its future performance. We explored a bunch of different models, ranging from parametric models to SARIMA to basic differencing. We combined all of our findings into a professional-style report, and summarized our findings in a silly blog post. Our model predicted future prices better than at least two-thirds of the class! Not only was this an exercise in different modelling techniques, but in Markdown and LaTeX syntax as well. Read our "blog" [here](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ischmidt/2020/stat-153-project/), or our more detailed final report [here](/assets/stat153.pdf), which also includes all of our R code.
