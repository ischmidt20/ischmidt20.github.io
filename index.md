### Data 100
Data 100 is an upper-divison data science course that "explores key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making."
- In [Summer 2020](http://www.ds100.org/su20/), I began as an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI). I led discussion sections, assisted in reviewing and releasing assignments, wrote and graded exams, in addition to helping students in remote video office hours, and through our online forum. I will continue in this role in the fall!
- In [Spring 2020](http://www.ds100.org/sp20/), I worked as a tutor, which involved grading homework and helping students in office hours.

### SAG @ Berkeley
[Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley](https://sportsanalytics.berkeley.edu/) is a student-run club that seeks to prepare members for a career in the sports industry. I am Vice President and head of the Projects Division, where students work on analytics-based consulting projects or their own independent research. My current responsibilities include recruiting new members to our club, overseeing the different individual projects, and reaching out to sports industry professionals to build connections for our club. Previously, I led a project team working with the San Francisco Giants—see [projects](projects) for more information.

### Research
- Starting in Summer 2020, I am a research assistant with [Professor Karen Chapple](http://karenchapple.com/). So far, I helped build a model to determine the factors affecting the construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in California. I also provided query results to the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/) to present in their policy brief, for which I was fortunate enough to be listed as a co-author. See [projects](projects) for more information.
- In Spring 2020, I assisted PhD Candidate [Teddy Forscher](https://tsrc.berkeley.edu/teddy-forscher) of the [Transportation Sustainability Research Center](https://tsrc.berkeley.edu/) with his research project on e-commerce shopping habits, the environment, and COVID-19. I cleaned and re-structured the results of his survey pre-test to guide the creation of his final survey, and then did the same with the final survey results to make the data easier to analyze. *"You're the best data wrangler I know." - Teddy Forscher*

### Other Work
- I am also a student assistant in the Facilities branch of UC Berkeley's Athletics Department. I help set up for games and practices at the basketball arena by moving basketball hoops around, and setting up and breaking down volleyball nets, the scorers' table, and other equipment. I also created inctructional videos that train others to do these tasks.
- Throughout high school and summers in college, I worked at [The Baird Center](https://southorange.org/249/Recreation-Cultural-Affairs), which holds the administrative offices for a local recreation department. At the front desk, I enrolled customers in activities, set up the center for town events, and was a point of contact for general questions about the department. I also enjoyed being involved in various youth sports organizations—I umpired youth baseball games (ages 9-13), and operated the scoreboard for middle school travel basketball games.
