# Teaching Data 100
Data 100 is an upper-divison data science course that "explores key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making."
- I am currently an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI), having started in [Summer 2020](http://www.ds100.org/su20/). I lead discussion sections, assist in reviewing and releasing assignments, write and grade exams, as well as help students in remote video office hours and through our online forum. Check out my anonymous student evaluations from the [summer](assets/evals/su20.pdf) and [fall](assets/evals/fa20.pdf).

In the Spring 2021 semester, I recorded videos that walked students through the weekly lab assignment. Check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu_CxYhhE8e0xQSqbEKV4kS-BnreoLqO)!

- In [Spring 2020](http://www.ds100.org/sp20/), I worked as a tutor, which involved grading homework and helping students in office hours.
- In Fall 2018 and Fall 2019, I worked as an academic intern for two other classes—[CS 61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/), then [Data 8](http://data8.org/fa19). An academic intern helps out GSIs in labs and office hours, and is considered the first rung on the teaching ladder.

# SAG @ Berkeley
[Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley](https://sportsanalytics.berkeley.edu/) is a student-run club that seeks to prepare members for a career in the sports industry. I am Vice President and head of the Projects Division, where students work on analytics-based consulting projects or their own independent research. My current responsibilities include recruiting new members to the club, overseeing the different individual projects, and reaching out to sports industry professionals to build connections. Prior to becoming VP, I led a project team working with the San Francisco Giants, and worked on a few other student teams—see [projects](/projects).

# Research
- Starting in Summer 2020, I am a research assistant with Berkeley's [Center for Community Innovation](https://communityinnovation.berkeley.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Karen Chapple](http://karenchapple.com/). So far, I helped build a model to determine the factors affecting the construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in California. I also provided query results to the [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/) to present in a policy brief, for which I was fortunate enough to be listed as a co-author. See [projects](/projects) for more information.
- In Spring 2020, I assisted PhD Candidate [Teddy Forscher](https://tsrc.berkeley.edu/teddy-forscher) of the [Transportation Sustainability Research Center](https://tsrc.berkeley.edu/) with his research project on e-commerce shopping habits, the environment, and COVID-19. I cleaned and re-structured the results of his survey pre-test to guide the creation of his final survey, and then did the same with the final survey results to make the data easier to analyze. *"You're the best data wrangler I know." - Teddy*

# Other Work
- I am a student assistant in the Facilities branch of UC Berkeley's Athletics Department. Before the onset of the virus, I set up [Haas Pavilion](https://calbears.com/sports/2020/6/22/haas-pavilion.aspx) for games and practices at by setting up and breaking down basketball hoops, volleyball nets, the scorers' table, and other equipment. I train new workers to do these tasks, both on-the-job and through instructional videos that I created. I was also a ballboy for a few Pac-12 volleyball games in 2019.
- Throughout high school and college summers, I worked at [The Baird Center](https://southorange.org/249/Recreation-Cultural-Affairs), which holds the administrative offices for a local recreation department. At the front desk, I enrolled customers in activities, set up the center for town events, and was a point of contact for general questions about the department. One summer, I was also a gate attendant at the community pool. Previously, I enjoyed being involved in various youth sports organizations—I umpired intramural baseball games (ages 9-13), and operated the scoreboard for middle school travel basketball games.
